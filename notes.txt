*** States ***
- Follower
- Candidate
- Leader


All nodes start in the follower state.

If follower didn't hear from the leader it can become a candidate.

The candidate becomes the leader if it gets votes from a majority of nodes.
But does it know whether it's a majority or not?


The election timeout is the amount of time a follower waits until becoming a candidate.
